All files in this folder are auto-generated by the conversion from ../../validator.proto

The conversion is done with [allegrophp](https://github.com/allegro/php-protobuf), since the official Protocol Buffer compiler for PHP doesn't support proto2 yet while validator.proto in [amphtml](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml) is written in proto2 (as of Mar 10, 2020).
